# Hexgate

**Hexgate is an efficient and easy to use UDP client-server game networking crate supporting encryption, reliability, authentication, and network simulation.**

‚ö†Ô∏è HEXGATE IS USABLE BUT NOT PRODUCTION READY ‚ö†Ô∏è

API MAY CHANGE QUITE A BIT.

CHECK OUT THE [ISSUES](https://github.com/alexdesander/hexgate/issues) FOR MORE INFORMATION

## Features
- Userfriendly API
    - with blocking and polling api calls
- Pure UDP
- Multi-platform (check out [mio's supported platforms](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mio#platforms))
- Connection oriented
- Message oriented
- Different delivery guarantees:
    - Unreliable
    - UnreliableOrdered (aka Sequenced)
    - Reliable
- Multiple virtual channels with weights (to avoid head-of-line blocking (problem in TCP))
    - Up to 256 reliable channels
    - Up to 256 unreliable ordered channels
- Runs on a dedicated thread
- Simple but powerful network simulation
- Cryptography:
    - SipHash authenticated initial server-hello (ddos protection)
    - Server auth based on ed25519 signatures
    - x25519 diffie hellman key exchange
    - AES256GCM / ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated encryption
    - SipHash authenticated acks (for performance reasons)
- Timeout detection
- Latency (Delay/Ping) probing
- Congestion control


Hexgate does NOT do:
- Serialization (recommendations: [bitcode](https://crates.io/crates/bitcode), [bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) (2.0))
- Compression (recommendation: [zstd](https://crates.io/crates/zstd))
- Peer-to-peer
- MTU discovery (minimum assumed MTU size is ~1250 bytes)

## Example
Creating and running a hexgate server:
```rust
/// Only for simplicity, allows every client to join.
struct UselessAuthenticator;
impl Authenticator<()> for UselessAuthenticator {
    fn authenticate(&mut self, _: SocketAddr, _: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
        Ok(())
    }
}

let server = Server::prepare()
    .bind_addr(SERVER_ADDR)
    .info(b"Example of a hexgate server".to_vec())
    .allowed_client_versions(|_| Ok(()))
    .secret_key([0u8; 32])
    .auth_salt([0u8; 16])
    .authenticator(UselessAuthenticator)
    .channel_config(ChannelConfiguration {
        weight_unreliable: 15,
        weights_unreliable_ordered: vec![4, 4],
        weights_reliable: vec![10, 10, 10],
    })
    .run()?;

match server.next() {
    _ => todo!("Handle server events")
}
```

Creating a hexgate client and connecting to a server:
```rust
let client = Client::prepare()
    .client_version(ClientVersion::ZERO)
    .server_socket_addr(SERVER_ADDR)
    .auth_data(username)
    .hash_auth_data(false)
    .channel_config(ChannelConfiguration {
        weight_unreliable: 15,
        weights_unreliable_ordered: vec![4, 4],
        weights_reliable: vec![10, 10, 10],
    })
    .connect()?;

client.send(Channel::Unreliable, vec![1, 2, 3])?;

match client.next() {
    _ => todo!("Handle client events")
}
```
